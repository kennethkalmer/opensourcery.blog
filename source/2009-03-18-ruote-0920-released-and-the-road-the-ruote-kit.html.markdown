Congratulations to John Mettraux for just [pushing ruote 0.9.20 out the door][1]. I&#8217;ve had the great privilege of working with John on an almost weekly basis, learning about ruote and discussing our complicated service provisioning processes with him. Recently I also presented ruote to our monthly Ruby on Beer group here in Johannesburg.

Looking forward, I&#8217;m excited to get ruote-kit going as a replacement to the current ruote-rest project. Below is a [gist from Github][2] that I&#8217;ve been using to plot my ideas for the project.
