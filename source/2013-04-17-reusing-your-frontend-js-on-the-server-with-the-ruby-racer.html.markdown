I can&#8217;t tell you how much fun it is typing out a blog post again. It has been nearly two years since the last post. I hope this will be the end of the dry spell for me.

Earlier this year at [Rubyfuza 2013][1] I had the privilege to share with the audience how, at [ValuationUP][2], we reuse our frontend JavaScript on the server side using [The Ruby Racer][3], allowing us to push the [SOLID][4] principles to the max by crossing the language barrier using [DI & IoC][5] across the language barriers.

The video and the slides are below for your enjoyment.

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="8fce6b6055b20130b56f12313815634b" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

The sample code lives at [kennethkalmer/rubyfuza-2013][6], and the working demo is up on [Heroku][7].

In the presentation I showed a 34 page PDF, and mentioned that the master branch was over 44 pages. As I&#8217;m typing this, we&#8217;re at 60+ pages and it shows no sign of stopping. Our clients are really loving the PDF output, and we&#8217;re getting better at crafting it for them.

If you&#8217;re an entrepreneur please check out [ValuationUP][2], or pass it along to your entrepreneurial friends. We can really help a privately held business unpack what is going on in their financials, highlight dangers, and point out the healthy parts.
