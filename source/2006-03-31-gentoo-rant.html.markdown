I&#8217;ve been playing with [Gentoo][1] the last couple of days, and what a pleasure it has been! I&#8217;ve moved most of my development from [PHP][2] to either [Python][3] or [Ruby][4] (more on that later), in favour of speed and productivity. [CentOS][5] was just giving me more troubles than I needed, not because of them but because of [RedHat][6] that uses ancient packages in their flagship distribution. I can understand why, but if you need to move with the times, you need an operating system that can respond quickly to your needs.

Try it, you&#8217;ll love it&#8230;.

Posts to come on [Xen][7], [Ruby][4] &#038; [Ruby on Rails][8], [Python][3] & [Django][9] and killing spam&#8230;
