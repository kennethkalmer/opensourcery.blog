Undoubtedly my worst time on stage ever! Ubuntu gave me issues with the projector, so I actually had to leave the stage to go to another conference hall to get the setup working again and run back up to the main hall&#8230; Once there, I was a mumbling mess, but made it through without the buzzer beating me.

Presenting a lightning talk at a Japanese conference is surely something else, the audience expects fireworks and the presenters deliver. It was truly an amazing experience, humilation and all, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the last day of the conference.
