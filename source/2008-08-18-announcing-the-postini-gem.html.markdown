Shortly after a week of training, and a very successful 6 week implementation of the Postini service, I&#8217;m proud to announce the &#8220;postini&#8221; gem.

Its still very rough around the edges, and probably pre-alpha, although its working nicely in our staging environment as part of a bigger system&#8230;

The library tries to abstract Postini SOAP API into something more palatable, and make it easy for other developers to leverage the powerful API to integrate with, and extend the Postini services. Find more information at [Rubyforge][1], and keep an eye on the [Github repository][2].

This work has been made possible by <a href="http://www.spaminabox.co.za" target="_blank">SPAM in a Box</a>, South Africa&#8217;s number one Postini reseller.
