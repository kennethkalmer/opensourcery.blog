Just as a quick update on the [PowerDNS on Rails][1] project, I&#8217;ve just pushed several updates to Github that most profoundly includes [support for audits][2]. Other smaller changes are also included, including plugin updates (HAML) and upgrading Rails to 2.0.4. As always, these updates have been running in production for a couple of hours already and has solicited some review from our support staff. Undoubtably there will be a lot of tweaks to the feature in the coming days&#8230;

Next on the radar is authentication tokens, allowing to give users one-time access to a specific domain for performing updates.

We&#8217;ll keep you posted!
