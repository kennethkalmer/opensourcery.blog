I checked up on ActiveRecord::Tableless and saw a fork that had some promising changes in, so I set out to pull those changes back to my repo. Seemed simple enough, I followed [Steven Bristol&#8217;s][1] steps and it worked.

The changes made by <span id="profile_name"><a href="http://blog.i5labs.com/2008/5/23/activerecord-tableless">Peter Wagenet</a> were simple and very useful, thanks Pete!</span>

I&#8217;ll start working on specs for the project closer to the end of the week, for now my focus is on getting BIND DLZ on Rails ready for its first public appearance.
