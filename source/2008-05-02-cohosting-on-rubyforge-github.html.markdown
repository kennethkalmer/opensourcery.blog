Thanks to [Dr Nic Williams][1] for highlighting this at such an awesome time. I&#8217;ve got the source for ActiveRecord::Tableless now on [GitHub][2] and [RubyForge][3], thanks to git. So you can grab a copy any time you want and contribute patches ðŸ˜ƒ

Get the code via from here:

`git clone git://rubyforge.org/tablelessmodels.git`

`git clone git://github.com/kennethkalmer/activerecord-tableless-models.git`

Leaps like this make sharing code a breeze, and makes one think how far you can still go with git before reaching the limits.
