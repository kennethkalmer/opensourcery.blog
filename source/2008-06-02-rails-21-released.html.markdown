Apart from my Rubyforge email alert, this seems to have pretty much go unnoticed so far. Think everyone was too busy attending RailsConf 2008.

* <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=307" target="_blank">Rails 2.1 @ Rubyforge</a>
* <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commits/v2.1.0" target="_blank">Rails 2.1 @ github</a>

Enjoy!
