[CIRT.net][1] is website providing some interesting tools to help webmasters secure their servers and their websites. Best of all it&#8217;s GPL!

Have a look at Nikto. From the website:

*Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 3100 potentially dangerous files/CGIs, versions on over 625 servers, and version specific problems on over 230 servers. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated (if desired).*

In todays world no server is safe, and with exploits now being discovered in more and more websites it doesn&#8217;t improve the admin&#8217;s odds.
