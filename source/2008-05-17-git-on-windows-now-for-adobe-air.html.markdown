Just picked up [this detailed post][1] for using git on Windows, thought I&#8217;d share it here too. And just in time as well, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time the last couple of days reading up on [Adobe Air][2] and making notes of possible applications I can play with in the coming months. Especially using [Air on Linux][3].

Now the thought of pushing some Air apps to github just became a reality, might help with the cross-pollination of git and air inside different communities&#8230;

Watch this space for some future Air apps sitting on a RESTful Ruby backend.
